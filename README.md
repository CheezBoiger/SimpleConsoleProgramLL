# SimpleConsoleProgramLL
Teh simple Cat Shell. Can do math by inputing postfix calculations. Can also convert numbers to strings and vice versa. 
Users can also rename themselves, store variables in memory, create scripts, and open up the shell recursively. if you plan
to try it yoself, fork this sucker, and compile it on your system. Run it like any usual application and type "help" for info
on how to work teh Cat Shell.
It is a simple program, one that I have done in my C++ programming course, lulz.


GAW IT FEELS GREAT TO BE A CAT!! ( =w=)
